- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnCarterGonzalez

- 👀 I’m interested in all things technology and development, love the outdoors and nature, and am an avid fly fishermen. I am always intensively curious about new tech and how it continues to develop and better serve people as a whole. I code in Java and Python primarily but am developing skills in several other languages as well.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS and Rust.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that deal with the abovementioned technologies and help to develop and deepen my own understanding of them, while being a part of a team and working to solve projects and problems. I can work in Full Stack Technologies such as: Flask, SpringBoot, and MERN.
