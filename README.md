- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnCarterGonzalez

- 👀 I’m interested in all things technology and development, love the outdoors and nature, and am an avid fly fishermen. My mind is always intensively curious about new tech and how it continues to develop and better serve people as a whole. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JS, and Java.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that deal with the abovementioned technologies and help to develop and deepen my own understand of them, while being a part
- of a team and working to solve projects and problems. 

- 📫 How to reach me:
-   email: gjohncarter@protonmail.com
